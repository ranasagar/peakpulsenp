This file is no longer used for footer content. Footer content is now managed in the Supabase 'site_configurations' table with config_key 'footerContent'.

Please refer to your Supabase dashboard or the admin panel at /admin/content/footer to manage this content.

If you need to restore initial data to Supabase, you can use the INSERT statement provided in the migration instructions for the 'site_configurations' table.
